    <h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman">An overview</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman" class="description">Geoffrey Everest Hinton (born December 6, 1947) is a British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist from England who is well known for his work on artificial neural networks. He has split his time between Google (Google Brain) and the University of Toronto since 2013. In 2017, he cofounded the Vector Institute in Toronto and became its Chief Scientific Advisor. Furthermore, Hinton co-authored a highly referenced study in 1986 with David E. Rumelhart and Ronald J. Williams that popularised the backpropagation technique for training multi-layer neural networks, but they were not the first to propose it. Hinton is regarded as a key figure in the deep learning community, and has been dubbed the "Godfather of Deep Learning" by some. The stunning image-recognition milestone achieved by his student Alex Krizhevsky's AlexNet for the ImageNet challenge 2012 revolutionised the area of computer vision. For his work in deep learning, Hinton shared the 2018 Turing Prize with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun. Some refer to Hinton, along with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, as the "godfathers of AI."</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman">Education</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman" class="description">Hinton obtained a Bachelor of Arts in experimental psychology from King's College, Cambridge, in 1970. He completed his studies at the University of Edinburgh, earning a PhD in artificial intelligence in 1978 for research supervised by Christopher Longuet-Higgins.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman">Career and Research</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman" class="description">Following his PhD, he worked at the University of Sussex, the University of California, San Diego, and Carnegie Mellon University (after struggling to secure funding in the United Kingdom). He is currently a professor in the computer science department at the University of Toronto and was the founding director of the Gatsby Charitable Foundation Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London. He has a Canada Research Chair in Machine Learning and is currently an advisor for the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research's Learning in Machines and Brains programme. In 2012, Hinton delivered a free online course on Neural Networks through the Coursera educational portal. When Hinton's startup, DNNresearch Inc., was acquired by Google in March 2013, he joined the company. He intends to "divide his time between his university research and his work at Google".</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman">Contributions</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman" class="description">Hinton's research investigates ways of using neural networks for machine learning, memory, perception and symbol processing. He has authored or co-authored over 200 peer reviewed publications. His other contributions to neural network research include distributed representations, time delay neural network, mixtures of experts, Helmholtz machines and Product of Experts.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman">Awards and Recognitions </h3>
    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman" class="description">In 1998, Hinton was named a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). In 2001, he was the first recipient of the Rumelhart Prize. Hinton received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Edinburgh in 2001. He received the IJCAI Award for Research Excellence lifetime achievement award in 2005. He also received the Herzberg Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering in 2011. Hinton received an Honorary Doctorate from the Université of Sherbrooke in 2013. Hinton was nominated Academy of Engineering as a foreign member in 2016 for "contributions to the theory and practise of artificial neural networks and their application to speech recognition and computer vision." He was also honoured with the IEEE/RSE Wolfson James Clerk Maxwell Award in 2016. Finally, the father of deep learning also shared the 2018 Turing Award with Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio for conceptual and engineering advances that have made deep neural networks a crucial component of computers.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Life</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman" class="description">Hinton is a great-great-grandson of both logician George Boole, whose work established one of the cornerstones of contemporary computer science, and physician and author James Hinton, Charles Howard Hinton's father. Howard Hinton was Hinton's father. George Everest, a distant relative, gave him his middle name. Colin Clark, the economist, is his uncle. Unfortunetaly, Hinton lost his first wife to cancer in 1994.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman">Other interesting facts</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman" class="description">Hinton moved from the U.S. to Canada in part due to disillusionment with Ronald Reagan-era politics and disapproval of military funding of artificial intelligence.</p>
